    "description": "Discipline within the Imperial Guard is harsh and, often, terminal. The Imperial Infantryman’s Uplifting Primer lists 22 transgressions punishable by death, 14 of those by shooting. While field execution is most associated with the Commissars of the Departmento Munitorum, they are not the only officers to take such action—whether officially sanctioned or not. The commanders responsible for shepherding penal legions quite often must make the ultimate sanction against their men, often in large groups. It is not unheard of for the leaders of particularly savage— or disciplined—regiments to do the same. The character is experienced in meting out such terminal punishment, and has honed these skills for maximum effect on the battlefield, both to motivate his allies and dishearten the enemy. Once per Combat Encounter after killing a target with a Ranged Attack, this character may spend a Fate Point and make a Challenging (+0) Command Test . If he succeeds, each of his allies within 10 metres gains a bonus equal to 5 times his Degrees of Success to the next Ballistic Skill or Weapon Skill Test he makes before the end of the encounter and each of his foes within 10 metres suffers a penalty equal to 5 times his Degrees of Success to the next Ballistic Skill or Weapon Skill Test he makes before the end of the encounter."

He strikes without hesitation, crushing his foes utterly in the name of the God-Emperor. In battle, doubt has no place in his mind and mercy holds no sway over his heart, for those who have fallen from the light of the God-Emperor find redemption only in annihilation. When the character inflicts Righteous Fury with an attack or Psychic Power for which he achieved three or more Degrees of Success on the attack roll or Focus Power Test, he rolls twice to determine the amount of Critical Damage he inflicts with Righteous Fury and takes the higher result."
